            classifier_fn: [function] classifier prediction probability function
            or decision function. For ScikitClassifiers, this is classifier.predict_proba
            or classifier.decision_function or classifier.predict_log_proba.
            Make sure the function only returns one (float) value. For instance, if you
            use a ScikitClassifier, transform the classifier.predict_proba as follows:

                def classifier_fn(X):
                    c=classification_model.predict_proba(X)

            Default is set to 30.

            vectorizer: [fitted object] a fitted vectorizer object

            threshold_classifier: [float] the threshold that is used for classifying
            instances as positive or not. When score or probability exceeds the
            threshold value, then the instance is predicted as positive.
            We have no default value, because it is important the user decides
            a good value for the threshold.

            feature_names_full: [numpy.array] contains the interpretable feature names,
            such as the words themselves in case of document classification or the names
            of visited URLs.

            time_maximum: [int] maximum time allowed to generate explanations,
            expressed in minutes. Default is set to 2 minutes (120 seconds).
